# Artificial Intelligence and Smart Cities: The Role of Intelligent Technologies in Building Sustainable and Livable Cities

# Introduction

Rapid urbanization is transforming the world, with more than half of the global population now living in cities. This trend presents both opportunities and challenges, including the need to build sustainable and livable cities that can accommodate growing populations while minimizing environmental impact.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and smart city technologies offer a promising solution to these challenges by enabling cities to become more efficient, innovative, and sustainable. In this book, we will explore the role of intelligent technologies in building sustainable and livable cities.

AI and smart city technologies have the potential to transform all aspects of urban life, from transportation and energy management to public safety and citizen engagement.

AI and smart city technologies are transforming the way we live, work, and interact with our environment. By developing comprehensive smart city strategies, building partnerships and collaborations, prioritizing data privacy and security, and promoting inclusion and equity, cities can build sustainable and livable communities that enrich the lives of residents while minimizing environmental impact. As technology continues to evolve and advance, it is essential to remain adaptable and prioritize the role of intelligent technologies in building sustainable and livable cities.
