Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important technology in recent years, with applications in a wide range of fields including healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and transportation. One area where AI is having a significant impact is in the development of smart cities.

Smart cities are cities that use intelligent technologies to improve quality of life for citizens, enhance sustainability, and promote economic growth. AI plays a critical role in this process by enabling cities to collect and analyze large amounts of data from various sources, such as sensors, cameras, and social media platforms. This data can be used to optimize city systems such as transportation, energy, and public safety.

In this book, we explore the role of AI in smart city development, focusing on its potential to build sustainable and livable cities. We examine various aspects of smart city development, including urban planning, transportation, energy, and healthcare, and show how AI can be used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance citizen engagement.

Overall, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the role of AI in smart city development. It highlights the potential of these technologies to transform the way we live and work, while also emphasizing the need for a collaborative and inclusive approach to smart city development.
