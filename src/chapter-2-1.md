Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives. It is used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, education, and many more. AI is also transforming our cities into smart cities by providing innovative solutions to urban challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss the fundamentals of AI, its definition, history, and development.

Definition of Artificial Intelligence
-------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks without human intervention. The goal of AI is to create machines that can reason, learn, perceive, and solve problems like humans. AI systems can be classified into two categories: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks, while general AI is designed to have human-like intelligence.

History of Artificial Intelligence
----------------------------------

The concept of AI was first introduced in the 1950s when computer scientists started working on developing machines that could reason and learn like humans. In 1956, John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Conference, where he coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and laid the foundation for the development of AI. In the following years, researchers made significant progress in AI, including the development of expert systems, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms.

Development of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------------

In recent years, the development of AI has accelerated due to advancements in computing power, big data, and cloud computing. Machine learning algorithms, which are a subset of AI, have made significant progress in areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, has enabled the development of neural networks that can learn from large amounts of data and make predictions with high accuracy.

Conclusion
----------

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming our world, and its impact on our cities is significant. By providing innovative solutions to urban challenges, AI is helping to create sustainable and livable cities. In this chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of AI, its definition, history, and development. As AI continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of our cities.
