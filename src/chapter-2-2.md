Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that aims to develop intelligent machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. There are various types of AI, each with its unique characteristics and applications.

1\. Reactive Machines
--------------------

Reactive machines are the most basic type of AI that can only react to specific inputs in a predetermined way. These machines cannot form memories or use past experiences to inform future decisions. Examples include Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer, and autonomous vehicles.

2\. Limited Memory
-----------------

Limited memory AI has the ability to learn from previous experience and modify their actions based on those experiences. However, they do not have the ability to store information over an extended period. Examples include self-driving cars and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.

3\. Theory of Mind
-----------------

Theory of mind AI seeks to understand human emotions, beliefs, and intentions. This type of AI can understand social cues and predict human behavior in specific contexts. However, they do not have consciousness or self-awareness. Examples include robots designed to interact with humans in social settings.

4\. Self-Aware AI
----------------

Self-aware AI is the most advanced type of AI that can understand its own existence and thought processes. These machines can recognize their limitations and improve upon them, leading to significant advancements in AI development. However, such AI currently does not exist, and researchers are still exploring ways to achieve this level of intelligence.

In conclusion, AI has many different types, each with its unique capabilities and applications. Understanding these different types is crucial in developing and utilizing AI for building sustainable and livable smart cities.
